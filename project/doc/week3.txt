* Title of your project:
  Network attached storage on SD (LPC2148)

* Project description:
  A device which will serve files located on an SD card attached to the LPC board through a web interface.
  The file system on the SD card will be standard Fat so that the SD can be pulled from a PC or a Camera and put in the device.
  The device will act as an independant server on the network getting a dynamic IP using a DHCP client (with an option to set a static IP).
  If time allows a USB control interface will be developed to upload files to the SD card and to configure device parameters (web server, IP config etc.)

                                     -----------------

* Currently we have:
   1. A working SD driver with read/write capabilities.
   2. A partial media storage device driver implementing the FatFS device driver interface.
   3. FatFS porting verified to read/write files to the root of the file system.
   4. A partial ethernet driver.
   5. A uIP port for the LPC2148 on top of the eth driver (Not fully tested)
   + A convenient makefile based build system for the project.

* Hardware on loan:
   1. LPC2148 + USB Cable
   2. Ethernet extension

* We think we would like to release the code as GPL.

* Target date for project submission: 14.2.10

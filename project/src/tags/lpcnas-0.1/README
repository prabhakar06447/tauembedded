 Problems and Solutions
------------------------

1. Set relevant jumpers to SPI0 for ethernet
2. Make sure to use the pins really connected to RESET and Chip Select of enc28j60 (P0.13, P0.12) and not the SPI slave select pin.
3. The default in my version of gnuarm is 32 alignment of structs (maybe of everything else as well). 
   So special care must be taken with structs which have several data types.
   For example:

   struct test_t {
       uint8_t x;
   };
   struct test_t a1;
   sizeof(a1) == 4

   On the other hand:
   
   struct test_packed_t {
        uint8_t x;
   } __attribute__((packed));
   struct test_packed_t a2;
   sizeof(a2) == 1
